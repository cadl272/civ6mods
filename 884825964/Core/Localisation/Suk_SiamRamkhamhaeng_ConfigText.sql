Even Siamese leaders would fight in battle on war elephants, indeed, King Ramkhamhaeng, King Naresuan and the consort of King Maha Chakkraphat, Sri Suriyothai have all fought atop Chang Suek."),

The waterways served as means of transportation and the center of economic activity as well. Boats were mainly used for both local and regional trade, bringing goods from those that produced to those that could barter and trade. Such heavy reliance on boats in riverside communities, especially in the Chao Phraya River Basin, helped increase the number of floating markets and allowed them to serve as hubs for the communities in Central Thailand for centuries."),
