		"The first six years of the Fifth Dalai Lama’s life resemble a novel. He was born to the noble Zahor family in 1617. In 1618, his father, Düdül Rabten, was involved in a plot against the royal government, which brought the king’s wrath upon him. Although the king had banned a search for the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation, the Gelukpa, secretly chose his son as the reincarnation of the Fourth Dalai Lama after three candidates drew lots before the holy image of Radreng monastery. Düdül Rabten attempted to escape to eastern Tibet but was prevented by royal envoys and brought to court at Samdrubtse where he remained under arrest until his death in 1626, without ever seeing his son again. His wife and son (aged three) were forced to remain in Dekyiling, then in Lhazong. The king suggested they come to live at court in Samdrubtse because of the insecurity caused by the war. But the mother, suspicious of the king’s real intentions, preferred to ignore his request and return to her family at the Nakartse castle. As soon as the ban on the quest for the reincarnation was lifted, envoys accompanied by Mongol delegates were sent to the king’s court, under the pretext of a diplomatic mission sent by Panchen Lobzang Chögyen, to request official recognition of the boy now living at Nakartse as the Fourth Dalai Lama’s reincarnation. Upon taking the seat of the Dalai Lamas in Drepung, Lobzang Gyatso immediately assumed the ritual responsibilities of the office, presiding over the New Year’s feast offering and the Sagadawa festivities in the fourth Tibetan month. He also began his studies, training in grammar and poetics, astrology and divination, and related topics. Lobzang Gyatso received his full monastic ordination in 1638."),

		"The Fifth Dalai Lama retained bitter memories of his childhood during which the philosophical and religious precepts relative to the notion of reincarnation served political purposes. In his writings he would often recall with irony the political manipulations of his own school, which involved the Mongols in all its affairs. In 1637, when Lobzang Gyatso was twenty-five, Gushri Khan (1582-1655), the leader of the Khoshot Mongols, came to Tibet with a contingent of eight hundred soldiers, ostensibly on pilgrimage, but almost certainly to assert control over Tibet and find native allies for their dominion. This was not unusual at the time – following the fracture of the Mongol peoples, leaders of various tribes had sought religious leaders in Tibet in an effort to reestablish the patron-priest model created by Kublai Khan. Gushri’s mission was at the request of the Fourth Dalai Lama’s treasurer, Sonam Chöphel, part of the latter’s effort to find a Mongol ally in the fight against Tsang. The Dalai Lama met with Gushri at this time and gave him the title of Tendzin Chogyel “holder of the teaching, king of dharma”. During this visit Gushri and the Dalai Lama discussed plans for Gushri to invade Kham and destroy the Bonpo kingdom of Beri, the excuse for which was a forged letter in which the Beri King declared his intention to invade Lhasa."),
		("LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_SUK_LOBSANG_GYATSO_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3",		"en_US",
		"In 1641, after a year of fighting, Gushri Khan defeated the king of Beri .During the campaign against Beri, the Fifth Dalai Lama and the Sonam Chöphel discussed the question of whether Gushri Khan and his men should return to Kokonor. They decided to send an emissary to Kham to contact the Mongol chief. In the presence of both the Dalai Lama and the emissary, the Sonam Chöphel pretended to agree with the Dalai Lama that Gushri Khan should return to Kokonor after his campaign in south-eastern Tibet. However, just as the emissary was about to leave, the Sonam Chöphel ordered him to tell Gushri Khan to lead his army against Tsang. Gushri then continued into Tibet. The Dalai Lama claims that he was horrified by this and demanded that Sonam Chöphel undo his work and convince Gushri to turn back, which he refused to do, evermore to hold the blame for Gushri’s violence. Gushri laid siege to Shigatse for roughly a year, ultimately crushing all resistance and taking control of Tsang. The Dalai Lama was then enthroned as King of Tibet at Samdrubtse and Gushri Khan offered him his conquests of central and eastern Tibet as a gift. The year 1642 was a crucial year and marked a turning point in Tibetan history because, for the first time, a Dalai Lama, previously merely the abbot of a monastery and leader of one religious school among several others, became the head of the country. The consequences of his rise to power were to be tremendous."),
		("LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_SUK_LOBSANG_GYATSO_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4",		"en_US",
		"The Dalai Lama spent the next several decades consolidating power, a process that involved the construction of a palace, naming himself an emanation of the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara (who had long been considered the patron protector of Tibet), a state visit to Beijing, and the invocation of the Golden Age of the Tibetan Empire. In 1645, the Fifth Dalai Lama began the construction of the Potala Palace on Red Hill in Lhasa, named after the pure land of the Avalokiteśvara, Potalaka, and placed on the site of the seventh century Tibetan Emperor Songtsen Gampo’s capital. Gushri Khan joined him for the consecration of the site. Under the Fifth Dalai Lama Lhasa flourished. Foreign traders and intellectuals flocked to the city, contributing greatly to the arts, medicine, and architecture. He established a wide infrastructure of taxation and administration, both in secular and religious matters."),
		("LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_SUK_LOBSANG_GYATSO_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5",		"en_US",
		"Over and above his political achievements, the Fifth Dalai Lama was far more concerned with spiritual matters. Writing was his favourite occupation and he never interrupted it whatever the circumstances, whether he was travelling or in retreat. His works fill twenty-seven volumes. Besides writing a number of treatises on various subjects, he also related his visionary experiences, which he kept secret because of his own religious school’s disapproval of such matters. He wrote in a very free and personal style that allowed him to express his own feelings, which were at once both frank and ironic. His autobiography is characterized by his spontaneity, his sarcasm and his humorous remarks concerning his own status as a reincarnation and the fundamentalist attitude of his own school, the Gelukpa. Very often, unlike other traditional Gelukpa authors, he gives his own independent interpretation, which he never attempts to impose."),
		("LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_SUK_LOBSANG_GYATSO_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_6",		"en_US",
		"The Fifth Dalai Lama continued to write until a few months before his death in 1682, at the age of 65. His exceptional personality, both complex and engaging, made him undeniably one of the most important figures in Tibetan history. His legacy was to have a profound effect on almost every aspect of the country’s culture, notably architecture, poetry, historiography, civil administration, painting and, of course, philosophy and Buddhist meditation. He was both a remarkable statesman and Buddhist monk, thus embodying the Buddhist ideal of a “great being”. Tibetan tradition still venerates him as the “Great Fifth”. His strict monastic discipline concealed yet another facet of his spiritual life: his great interest for tantric, more or less magical rituals, and, above all, his inclination for mystic meditation, which provided him with a series of visionary experiences throughout his life. These he revealed only in his writings, which remained little known in his time and which show his never ceasing concern for the welfare of his country and people.");
