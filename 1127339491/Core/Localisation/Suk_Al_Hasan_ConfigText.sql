The simplest tomb structures were rectangular enclosures, bounded by four low walls, varying in size and scale. The most distinctive and unusual feature of many Swahili medieval tombs was the addition of a tall column-like structure, forming a characteristic building type along the East African coast referred to as pillar tombs. These pillars come in many sizes and shapes, from rounded, square, multisided or fluted and rose to various heights. These pillars, and sometimes parts of the surrounding enclosure walls, were often decorated with inset porcelain or other glazed ceramic bowls imported from southern Arabia, Persia and even as far as China, adding a dash of color to contrast with the brilliant white plaster surfaces, forming a distinctive decorative tradition unique to the medieval East African coast."),

Ternate and neighbouring Tidore were the world's single major producer of cloves, upon which their rulers became among the wealthiest and most powerful sultans in the Indonesian region. Much of their wealth, however, was wasted fighting each other. Up until the Dutch completed the colonisation of Maluku in the 19th century, the Sultans of Ternate ruled empires that claimed at least nominal influence as far as Ambon, Sulawesi and Papua."	),

In 1607 the Dutch came back to Ternate, where with the help of Ternateans they built a fort in Malayo. The island was divided between the two powers: the Spaniards were allied with Tidore and the Dutch with their Ternaten allies. Desiring to restore Ternate to its former glory and expel the western power, Sultan Sibori of Ternate (1675–1691) declared war to the Dutch, but the power of Ternate had greatly reduced over the years, he lost and was forced to concede more of his lands to the Dutch by an unjust treaty in 1683. By this treaty, Ternate had lost its equal position with the Dutch and became a vassal. However, the Sultans of Ternate and its people were never fully under Dutch control."	),

The throne of Ternate was left vacant from 1914 to 1927, until the board of ministers under the blessing of the Dutch created Crown Prince Iskandar Muhammad Jabir the next Sultan. The dynasty founded by Baab Mashur Malamo continues to the present, as does the Sultanate itself, although it no longer holds any political power."),
