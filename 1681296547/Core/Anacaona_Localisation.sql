	"Anacaona was a Taino cacica (chief) born into a family of chiefs, and sister of Bohechío, chief of Jaragua. Her husband was Caonabo, chief of the nearby territory of Maguana. Her brother and her husband were two of the five highest caciques who ruled the island of Kiskeya (now called Haiti and Dominican Republic) when the Spaniards settled there in 1492. She was celebrated as a composer of ballads and narrative poems, called areítos. She is immortalised in the intertwining histories of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with many in Haiti claiming her as a significant icon in early Haitian history and a primordial founder of their country."),

	"Anacaona was born in Maguana (near present-day Léogâne), where her Brother was Chieftain in 1474. During Christopher Columbus's visit in late 1496, Anacaona and her brother Bohechío appeared as equal negotiators. On that occasion, described by Bartolomé de las Casas in Historia de las Indias, Columbus successfully negotiated for tribute of food and cotton to be paid by the natives to the Spanish under his command."),
	("en_US", "LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CVS_ANACAONA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3",		
	"The visit is described as having taken place in a friendly atmosphere. Several months later, Columbus arrived with a caravel to collect a part of the tribute. Anacaona and Bohechío had sailed briefly aboard the caravel, near today's Léogâne in the Gulf of Gonâve as his guests. At first relations between natives and Conquistadors were cordial, the natives realizing too late their lands were actually being stolen and their subjects enslaved."),
	("en_US", "LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CVS_ANACAONA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4",		
	"Anacaona's high status was probably strengthened by elements of matrilineal descent in the Taino society. Taino caciques usually passed inheritance to the eldest children of their sisters. If their sisters had no children, then they chose among the children of their brothers, and when there were none, they fell back upon one of their own."),
	("en_US", "LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_CVS_ANACAONA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5",		
	"Anacaona became chief of Jaragua after her brother's death. Her husband Caonabo, suspected of having organized the attack on La Navidad (a Spanish settlement on north-western Hispaniola), was captured by Alonso de Ojeda and shipped to Spain, dying in a shipwreck during the journey, as many other Taino leaders died on Spanish ships away from their native lands. The Tainos, being ill-treated by the conquerors, revolted and made a long war against them."),

	"In 1503 during a meeting of 80 caciques, including Anacaona, the Spanish Governor Nicolás de Ovando ordered the meeting house to be set on fire to burn them alive. Cacica Anacaona and her Taino noblemen were arrested  all accused of conspiracy for resisting occupation and executed."),

	"Prior to her execution, Anacaona was offered clemency if she would give herself as concubine to one of the Spaniards which was common in the era. Standing with her fellow Tainos in solidarity, the Caribbean indigenous cacica chose execution over colluding with her Spanish enemy, her refusal cementing her legend. Anacaona remained rebellious and independent until her violent public death. Because Anacaona refused the sexual offer of the Spanish intruders while others were shot, Anacaona was executed by hanging. She was only 29 years old."),

	"Taino groups in the more developed islands, such as Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Jamaica, relied more on agriculture (farming and other jobs). Fields for important root crops, such as the staple yuca, were prepared by heaping up mounds of soil, called conucos."),
	("en_US", "LOC_PEDIA_IMPROVEMENTS_PAGE_IMPROVEMENT_CVS_ANACAONA_UI_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2",	
	"This improved soil drainage and fertility as well as delaying erosion, allowing for longer storage of crops in the ground. Less important crops such as corn were raised in simple clearings created by slash and burn technique."),

	"Typically, conucos were three feet high and nine feet in circumference and were arranged in rows. The primary root crop was yuca/cassava, a woody shrub cultivated for its edible and starchy tuberous root. It was planted using a coa, a kind of hoe made completely from wood. Women processed the poisonous variety of cassava by squeezing it to extract the toxic juices. Then they would grind the roots into flour for baking bread. Batata (sweet potato) was the next most important root crop.");
